# Loop Detection
Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the beginning of the loop.

## Definition
*Circular linked list*: a (corrupt) linked list in which a node's next pointer points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list.

## Example
<pre>
Input:      A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]
Output:     C
</pre>
